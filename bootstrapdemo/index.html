                        <p>Chapter 6th starts with three years’ time lapse. The reader gets an interesting picture of little old Pearl. Hester and Pearl are lonely companions of each other, their relationship and deep love which Hester feels for Pearl whom
                            she can not understand and whom she half-fears, adds pathos to the story. Their relationship for me as a reader is something I want to see how will develop because there is a lot to come. The sin in this chapter is discussed
                            very tensely. Hawthorn probably does not think that Hester’s sin is unforgivable, but neither Hawthorne nor Hester views the sin lightly. The next chapter displays Hawthorn’s imagination in developing his symbols. The letter
                            A, in general, a very simple symbol might represent two striking variations: The magnified A in the breastplate and pearl as a living version of the scarlet letter, this is a symbol which I found very interesting. It seems
                            like in almost every chapter Hester fights herself because she loves her child but at the same time, she reminds her of that unforgivable sin that she made. What I liked in this chapter is that characterization of Hester and
                            Pearl is focused on. Pearl has almost fiendish qualities which are made more vivid. Hester’s proud and defiant acceptance of her punishment is demonstrated in pearl’s outfit that Hester chose. There are these and many symbols
                            that say a lot. While reading you can see pearl’s troubling personality. At the end of the chapter, Pearl screams because she wants a rose from the bush, outside of the window. This part recalls the first chapter where the
                            rose bush represents pureness and virginity. It’s a little Ironic when Pearl wants something that her mother is the opposite of. The 8th chapter was especially interesting for me because for the first time since the opening
                            scene the author brings together these four characters who seem to have an important role in the book. In this chapter, we saw many confusing parts and hints that might get clear in the future but for now, it made me full of
                            questions. Why doesn’t Dimmesdale support Hester’s punishment? The author says that: “he took a brief and reluctant part in the scene of Hester’s disgrace”. Why is he different? Is it something personal? Why did the minister
                            kiss pearl on the head? Was that just a kind behavior or something more complicated is going on? The ninth chapter is another slow-moving chapter, and it shows the dangerous relationship between Chillingworth and Dimmesdale.
                            It’s obvious that Chillingworth is picking some hints and he is about to see the whole picture and truth and meanwhile it’s so interesting how the satanic metamorphosis takes place in his character. “Few people could tell whence,
                            dropping down, as it were, out of the sky, or starting from the nether earth.” No one knew he was sent by a god or a Satan and I can’t wait to see how his character is going to develop.
