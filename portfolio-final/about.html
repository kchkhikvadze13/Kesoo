                Hi, there <br>
                <br> I am keso chkhikvadze from  Republic of Georgia. Sometimes, when I say Georgia, some People think I am from the state but no, I am on the opposite side of the USA.  from another continent. My country is located at the edge of Europe and Asia, under The Caucausian Mountains. I was born in a small settlement called Kharagauli. My home is a part of  Borjomi-kharagauli National Park. 18 years ago my home was so tiny and poor. I can not say it changed more, but sometimes it looks like a special place for foreigner people.  <br> <br>
                I studied at Kharagauli’s school. I love history, foreing languages and computer science. I like  writing, when the words express all your thoughts. For me the school is a place where you can improve yourself and  try many different  activities. I was lucky and my old school really helped me to try  many different types of  activities. I  took part in / and organized many projects, school events which were organized for   important or remarkable days. made cleaning events  in my home-town, read books for other students,  took part in Tbilisi State University’s  events.  <br> <br>
                I consider that  non-formal education is one  of the most important elemtn for  students’ education.  From my middle age I changed my direction and all my interests became non-formal educational  activities.  For 4 years I was a participant and finalist of one of the big  projects called “ Niko Keskhovely award.'', organized by CENN. During these years  me and my fellow classmates created eco club. Made many cleaning events. Spread awareness about environmental safety, how to use resources well and etc.. Behalf the project, every year we planted many trees in other places and territories. I was a main presentator and negotiator  of the final project meetings. We won the grant for school  and I went to an environmental camp for 3 summers in a row. All those camps and the experience which I gained here helped  me to open the  new door of interest. <br> <br>I am keen on of the Computer siencies. IT is a field  which I always wanted to be a part of. The first meeting about  technologies for me was many years ago in a Robotechnic camp. I was surprised how the human mind created machine intelligence. After, I tried to start coding. Besides I was a volunteer journalist for a local media-newspaper. Also, I was working as a media checker and I tried to find false information through the internet. After that started the big competition and hard  work for FLEX- 22.(Future Leaders EXchange)  One of the main reasons why I wanted to be a part of the FLEX program was exactly coding and IT Besides sharing my culture and learnin more about the USA). <br> <br>  So, here I am today. Moving towards my dreams and goals. If you are reading this, means u came here because you a great, bright idea and need a website for it. Don’t hesitate. Contact me!
