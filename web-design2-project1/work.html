            <p> this is my favorite essay about feminism. I wrote it a year ago and I'm very proud of it</p>
            <h1>
                we all should be feminists
            </h1>
            <p> Please, sit down.<br> Are you comfortable? You can also grab a cup of coffee…<br> No, please, do not scroll… You must listen to me, you have to read this, you have a commitment to be interested in this because together we ought to make changes,
                you must make changes for yourself, for me, for little girls and boys, for the whole world… This may sound incredible; you may think you are unable to change the world. Have no fear, do not give in, continue reading – everything sounds
                incredible until we make it reality. 200 years ago, nobody believed a woman could win a Nobel Prize, but guess what happened? Marie Curie has won it! She made the change; she made the world believe that human gender does not define knowledge
                and potential of a person. Need more motivation? OK. <br> Women in the USA gained electoral rights in 1920. They struggled, organized numerous campaigns and manifestations, raised their voices, they dared, and they achieved the goal. <br>

            <p>
                Today, in 2021, can you imagine the elections withholding your voting rights only on account of your feminine gender? I believe it’s difficult, whereas in 1920 it was difficult for women to imagine elections and the world in general that would respected
                their rights, care about their opinion, the world where they would be full-fledged members of the society. <br> You may argue that it is not 1920 now, and even if it is not a very distant past, today women’s rights are
                not violated. You may think that today there is no need to struggle for your rights and equality, and for establishing oneself. I am sorry but I have to say that you are mistaken, you are seriously mistaken. <br> Even today women are dominated
                because they are women, even today they are paid less compared to men, why? Because they are women. Even today some people believe that a woman is unable to lead a country, that she is not strong and smart enough. Even today the society
                considers that women have one and only obligation – to have a family, raise children and care about the growth of population in the country. The society limits you even today telling that you cannot master your dream profession because
                you are a woman, and because it is inappropriate for you. You are told that you must not wear the clothes you wear because they are inappropriate to you. You are told that it is time to marry and have children, telling… telling… telling…
                but never listening to you. <br>I am sure, you have been told this and many other phrases, I am sure your gender had created even a small obstacle at some point in the past, and I am sure you want to stop this. I know you want to struggle
                for your rights, I know you have the voice, but you need an urge to make this voice louder, I know you can prove you are a dignified and fully valid person. I know you wish little girls who start self-searching and self-analysis, not to
                feel subjugated; I know you wish little boys who are not yet discriminating people by their gender, to stay the same. <br> And if this is right, if this is your aspiration, then get ready. Now I will mention the word that scares others,
                the word that the society despises so much.

                <br> If this is your aspiration, you must be a feminist. <br>

                <br> Feminism. <br>

                <br> An interesting word, isn’t it? You are familiar with it, you may hear it today from many, but the society has played its role in its understanding and meaning, and has changed its context somewhat. At least 8 average people from 10
                will tell you that feminism implies struggle for women’s rights and their advancement. Though actually the term feminism which originated in France in 1838, means equality. Women had never requested more rights than men have. Try and recall
                at least one fact or historical occasion when women attempted to violate men’s rights or to oppress them. <br> You cannot recall even one, can you? Quite the opposite, you can easily make a list of the events when women struggled for the
                equal rights with men.

                <br>I am Keso, I am 17 and I believe feminism implies freedom, equality, and struggle for my own and many other girls’ rights. I am proud to tell you that I am a feminist since I see that we have not attained equality up to now. I will
                struggle for you, and you will struggle for me. <br>

                <br> Do you still think we cannot change the world together? Cannot attain equality? You and I, and lots of other dedicated, smart, strong, and independent women? Together we can do more that we imagine. So, stand up, be proud to tell
                you are a feminist, go out and struggle for us, I believe in you but first, you must believe in yourself.
